# ct-chargen-vue

Vue project to inline a Classic Traveller character generator into an existing webpage

DIST folder has the condensed scripts resulting from `npm run build` , and the Plugin-prep folder contains a stub WP plugin utilizing the resulting script files.



## Status

The app now cycles through the entire career cycle up through discharge, but not including muster-out benefits. Aging, existing skills, and cascade skills are accounted for. 

## Major todo goals

Now that I've gotten the ship builder - separate project - tonnage complete, we will finish addressing muster out benefits. 

After that, I hope to print the "TAS Form" on the right as a self-contained sheet. That is a lower priority, and my wait until I get costs/etc. done for the ship builder project complete.
