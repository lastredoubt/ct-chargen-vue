    <h1> Welcome to Traveller Tools</h1>
    <p>We're just getting started here, with the first project being the creation of an interactive Classic Traveller character generator, in accordance with the rules in the Traveller Book </p>
    <p>Later projects may include other generation tools including using the later books (Mercenary, High Guard, etc.), for character generation as well as star systems, ship builders, or outright expension into Cepheus Deluxe</p>
